<h2>Careless Whisper</h2>
<em>Written by: Goerge Michael</em>
<br /v>
<strong>[Intro]</strong>
</p>Oh, woah, woah, oh-oh</p>
<strong>[Verse 1]</strong>
<p>I feel so unsure</p>
<p>As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor</p>
<p>As the music dies, something in your eyes</p>
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes</p>
<br /v>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
<p>I'm never gonna dance again</p>
<p>Guilty feet have got no rhythm</p>
<p>Though it's easy to pretend</p>
<p>I know you're not a fool</p>
<p>I should have known better than to cheat a friend</p>
<p>And waste the chance that I'd been given</p>
<p>So I'm never gonna dance again</p>
<p>The way I danced with you, oh</p>
<br /v>
<strong>[Verse 2]</strong>
<p>Time can never mend</p>
<p>The careless whispers of a good friend</p>
<p>To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind</p>
<p>There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find</p>
<br /v>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
</p>I'm never gonna dance again</p>
<p>Guilty feet have got no rhythm</p>
<p>Though it's easy to pretend</p>
<p>I know you're not a fool</p>
<p>I should have known better than to cheat a friend (Shoulda known better, yeah)</p>
<p>And waste the chance that I'd been given</p>
<p>So I'm never gonna dance again</p>
<p>The way I danced with you, oh</p>
<br /v>

<strong>[Verse 3]</strong>
<p>Tonight, the music seems so loud</p>
<p>I wish that we could lose this crowd</p>
<p>Maybe it's better this way</p>
<p>We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say</p>
<p>We could have been so good together</p>
<p>We could have lived this dance forever</p>
<p>But now, who's gonna dance with me?</p>
<p>Please stay</p>
<br /v>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
<p>And I'm never gonna dance again</p>
<p>Guilty feet have got no rhythm</p>
<p>Though it's easy to pretend</p>
<p>I know you're not a fool</p>
<p>I should have known better than to cheat a friend</p>
<p>And waste the chance that I'd been given</p>
<p>So I'm never gonna dance again</p>
<p>The way I danced with you, oh</p>
<br /v>
<strong>[Instrumental Break]</strong>
